      "MELENDI (Medical Expert Linguist for Evaluating Nosology and Diagnosis Information) is a recommendation system that helps medical professionals find relevant articles by analyzing patient discharge summaries and scientific publications. The system, which was positively evaluated by medical specialists, suggests articles based on a patient's diagnosis, aiming to efficiently keep doctors updated on the latest literature.",

      "A new automated technique called RadIA uses advanced speech recognition and text classification to effectively monitor radio advertisements. Unlike traditional methods, RadIA doesn't need prior knowledge of ad content, allowing it to detect impromptu or new ads. The model, trained on carefully segmented text data, achieved an impressive F1-macro score of 87.76. This technology has the potential to help companies monitor ad broadcast compliance and analyze competitors' ad strategies.",

      "Dictionaries are one of the oldest and most used linguistic resources. Building them is a complex task that, to the best of our knowledge, has yet to be explored with generative Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the \"Spanish Built Factual Freectianary\" (Spanish-BFF) as the first Spanish AI-generated dictionary. This first-of-its-kind free dictionary uses GPT-3. We also define future steps we aim to follow to improve this initial commitment to the field, such as more additional languages.",

      "TLinguistic ambiguity is and has always been one of the main challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Modern Transformer architectures like BERT, T5 or more recently InstructGPT have achieved some impressive improvements in many NLP fields, but there is still plenty of work to do. Motivated by the uproar caused by ChatGPT, in this paper we provide an introduction to linguistic ambiguity, its varieties and their relevance in modern NLP, and perform an extensive empiric analysis. ChatGPT strengths and weaknesses are revealed, as well as strategies to get the most of this model.",

      "This Master's Thesis presents a new architecture for Information Retrieval systems in Spanish. This architecture is based on the techniques that have yielded the best results in English, thanks to recent advances in Natural Language Processing. Specifically, it uses a hybrid retrieval system that merges the speed of classical probabilistic models with the efficiency of models based on modern neural networks. Additionally, the thesis proposes a new dataset, called \"RISQAC,\" to evaluate Information Retrieval systems in Spanish.",

      "This paper presents a novel and linguistic-driven system for the Spanish Reverse Dictionary task of SemEval-2022 Task 1. The aim of this task is the automatic generation of a word using its gloss. The conclusion is that this task results could improve if the quality of the dataset did as well by incorporating high-quality lexicographic data. Therefore, in this paper we analyze the main gaps in the proposed dataset and describe how these limitations could be tackled.",
